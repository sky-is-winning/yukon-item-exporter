    Ruffle failed to load the required ".wasm" file component.

    If you are the server administrator, please consult the Ruffle wiki for help.

    Ruffle failed to load the Flash SWF file.
    The most likely reason is that the file no longer exists, so there is nothing for Ruffle to load.
    Try contacting the website administrator for help.

    Ruffle has encountered a major issue whilst trying to initialize.
    This can often resolve itself, so you can try reloading the page.
    Otherwise, please contact the website administrator.
error-wasm-disabled-on-edge =
    Ruffle failed to load the required ".wasm" file component.
    To fix this, try opening your browser's settings, clicking "Privacy, search, and services", scrolling down, and turning off "Enhance your security on the web".
    This will allow your browser to load the required ".wasm" files.
    If the issue persists, you might have to use a different browser.
error-javascript-conflict =

error-csp-conflict =
    Ruffle has encountered a major issue whilst trying to initialize.
    This web server's Content Security Policy does not allow the required ".wasm" component to run.
    If you are the server administrator, please consult the Ruffle wiki for help.

    Ruffle has encountered a major issue whilst trying to display this Flash content.
    {$outdated ->
        [true] If you are the server administrator, please try to upload a more recent version of Ruffle (current build is outdated: {$buildDate}).
